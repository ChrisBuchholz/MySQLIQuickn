MySQLIQuickn
===============================================================================

Small library that makes using MySQLI even quicker to get done
for the generel CRUD tasks that you use again, and again and again...
 
Written solely for the purpose of use for my PHP assignments in school.

## Usage

Should be quite self-explanatory.
Only requirements is of five defined constants which are:

 * MYSQL_HOST
 * MYSQL_USER
 * MYSQL_PASSWORD
 * MYSQL_DATABASE
 * MYSQL_CHARSET
